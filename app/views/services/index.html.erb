  	<h2>Password Strength Check</h2>
  	<br>
		<p>As a payment processor security is something that is of upmost importance to us. One aspect of security is ensuring that users set strong passwords. Weâ€™d like you to write a routine that verifies password strength using the following rules:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>All passwords must be at least 8 characters in length</li>
			<li>All passwords must contain at least one capital letter</li>
			<li>All passwords must contain at least 2 digits</li>
			<li>All passwords must contain a punctuation character (non Alpha-Numeric)</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Extra Credit</h3>
		<p>Create a utility for suggesting a password in cases where the strength is not sufficient. You should utilize some element of what the user entered for the suggested new password.</p>
